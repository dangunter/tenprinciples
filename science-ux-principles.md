## 1. Solve the right problem first

Computer scientists often focus on the problem that they are
interested in, which might be a longer-term outlook. However, a good
science engagement strategy will solve the right problem, the one
is affecting the users *today*, first.

**Example**: In a science engagement with one of the science
facilities, we were focused on learning their long term data
problems. However, the user had a complex system of managing data on
external hard disks and was running out of space and needed that
problem solved first.

## 2. Understand user motivations

It is important to understand the user's motivation to participate in
the science engagement - what do they want to change and why do they
want it. Understanding a user's motivations for the engagement is a
good indicator of their time investment in the project and also
willingness for change.

**Example**: Many of us have seen screenshots similar to these where
 people have complex processes to manage the software and scripts and
 data from their simulations and effectively have metadata and
 provenance in file names. A user who has growing volumes of data
 might be motivated to change this status quo whereas a user who
 doesn't have any challenges right now may not care to change the
 complex yet working system.

## 3. Understand the context of use

It is important to understand the context of use of the system to be
designed. For example, if we don't know where and how the scientists
are collecting the data, the system we build probably won't be
useful. 

**Example**: Knowing that data would be collected in the field
in fairly difficult physical conditions changes the design of not just
the mobile interface but also the backend that would support the data
entry on sometimes spotty wireless signals.

## 4. Validate and verify what you have heard

We often struggle with dealing with the chaos of conflicting user
requirements including - "what do they actually mean?" User research processes enable you to work through these requirements
to come up with solid recommendations and priorities.

**Example**: One such method that we have used is detailed
[here](http://lbl-udablog.blogspot.com/2015/12/evaluating-proposed-capabilities-to-be_1.html UDABlog).

    
## 5. Test before building; test after building

It is critical to test how an user will interact with a system before
even building the system, and subsequently with early
prototypes. Usability studies provide a methodology to conduct and
learn from these tests. Traditionally, the methodology has been used
for web interfaces but we have experimented with using the methods for
APIs and found it tremendously useful. A good book on the topic is Steve Krug's
[Rocket Surgery Made Easy](https://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy--Yourself/dp/0321657292/ref=sr_1_1) and [our paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6972276/ Tigres Paper)
that details the methodology we used for APIs

**Example**: We did a "paper prototype" usability for an API, to get feedback
from our user on nomenclature and understand what our users valued
the most. After developing a product, we performed a second round of
usability study -- this time, to study the effectiveness of using
the API more thoroughly, and over a longer time period.

## 6.  Clean interfaces can't make up for bad design

User interfaces need to be an essential part of system design and
needs to capture the user's mental model. A clean user interface added
at the end cannot make up for bad design. Also, a bad user interface
can affect a good design.

**Example**: We found in one case that users preferred a file level UI better since
it captured their mental model than a UI that was clean but didn't
capture their mental model of the data layout.

## 7. Build for the right user

It is important to identify who the users of the system are and build
for them. "What would I do?" may be extremely misleading, if you are
not representative of the end user. You have to continually ask
yourself whether you are really modeling a real user, or just
targeting someone who is convenient for you to think about (like
yourself!).

**Example**: In a research project, we discovered that since the tool
was initially built for experimentation purposes by computer
scientists, there was no clear mechanism provided to access the output
data from the runs. When the tool started getting used by science
users, this was a hurdle and needed to be fixed.

## 8. Understand the user's metrics

When computer engineers think about porting codes to HPC, they tend to
think about performance of the codes. This is only one part of the
picture. When we talked to users, they consistently worried about
their own time -- time waiting to run, time debugging, etc. -- as the
primary metric. If running on HPC is wasting too much of their time,
performance gains of the code itself are not very
important. Productivity, publication deadlines, etc. are often the
user's metrics and needs to be taken into account when designing the
system.

## 9. Cost / Benefit for the science team is different from the development team 

It is important to remember that the cost/benefit analyses that a
science team might do is often different from the analyses that a
development team might do. For example, a development team might be
willing to invest in performance improvements in the code. However,
the time investment in this might not look beneficial to the scientist
if it does not improve the science result in some way.


## 10. Be willing to iterate (early and often)

It is important to be willing to iterate and engage the users early
and often. It is critical that developers don't get attached to their
designs and are willing to pivot the development process. The [Lean
Startup book](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation-ebook/dp/B004J4XGN6 LeanStartup)
discusses some of the topics that are relavant in the development
cycle.
